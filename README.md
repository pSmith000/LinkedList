LinkedList:

The program first creates two new lists, called list and listTwo. The next thing that the program does
is add several numbers to list in different ways, by inserting, pushing to the front, and pushing to the back.
The list is sorted from least to greatest. Next listTwo gets a number inserted, sorted, and set equal to list in 
that order. Then, for the iteration of list, if there is a 10 the program prints "success". Then both lists
are printed.
